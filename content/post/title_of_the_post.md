# First Post Here!
<!--more-->

Hello! This is my first post on my site. excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and , _hopefully_,projects here.

Built this site hosted with [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) and I used this great (_or traumautizing_) [`theme`](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/github-style/) by [MeiK2333](https://github.com/MeiK2333)

## What to Expect

I plan to cover topics like:

1. Tech – tools, frameworks, new ideas and much more
2. Experiences – Friends and families. Some new or even old experiences   

## My Goals

> "I want this site to be a space where I can document my learning journey, share insights and thoughts. And hopefully be able to revisit this when I'm older"
