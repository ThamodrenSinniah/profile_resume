## About Me

Hello! I’m **Thamo**, a **Software Development Engineer in Testing**, with more than **5 years** of experience.
I'm based in 🇲🇾 (Malaysia, Boleh!) and enjoy a myriad of activities that would make a circus manager jealous.

## About this Site

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. It’s part online portfolio, part resume, part blog, and part procrastination diary — basically the digital equivalent of a messy desk.  Future me will thank past me for the reminder of how chaotic this all is.

## Actual Fun Stuff
Some cool stuff I enjoy (_not work-related, because that's boring_):
- `Homelabbing` – resurrected an old laptop and hosted a circus of services: JellyFin, Proxmox, Nginx Proxy Manager, and even a local AI model running on Ollama. The laptop is still sweating.
- `Heavy Metal` – been a headbanger since before I knew what a headbanger was. From Metallica to the most obscure (yes, Infant Annihilator!), the neighbors are not fans of my electric guitar riffs. Currenly own a stock Jackson JS32T King V and a lonely Ibanez GIO GRX20.
- `Fitness` – lifting weights for over 6 years. Started at 49 kg, now almost 80 kg. I follow a Push-Pull-Legs routine where strength meets hypertrophy and a lot of grunting.
- `Transformers` – ALL HAIL LORD MEGATRON!
- `Dinosaurs` – **Dinosaur (2000)** is the greatest dinosaur movie ever made. Don't @ me.
